## Don't install OSX Yosemite Yet

I have been using yosemite since it was published and it has a lot of problems seriously. The biggest problem is the WLAN, that disconnects often. Even with the newest OSX Yosemite .3 updates it won’t fix the WLAN problems.   

I also made a fresh install on both my 2014 MacBook Pro 15” Retina and still it had the same problems. Even if you look for the forums and discussions, there is no ”real” fix for the issue. I’ve had also had some crashes and graphics seems slower than in Maverics.. So I decided to get back to maverick, and everything is working perfectly on it.. So I suggest that you don’t upgrade to Yosemite yet..
