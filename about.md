My name is Kari Skytt채 and I was born 1978 in Finland. I'm a technology nerd with really strong programming and infrastructure background. 
My hobbies are:

* Enjoying life with my family (wife, two kids, two dogs and two cats)
* Programming (mainly focused on Java)
* Anything related to technology
* Hunting (mainly ducs)
* Training dogs for hunting tests ( two flatcoated retrievers)

I enjoy testing new things and always seek for a better solution to make things better.  I currently work as Systems Architecht in Finnish Energy company and I'm responsible of site management (Software development and IT-operations & infrastructure teams) and whole IT-infrastructure. 

I started this blog because I wanted to share knowledge and things I have already solved. This way it could be easier for you to use and enjoy techologies I like the most.  I will try to write as often as possible at least once at every month.
